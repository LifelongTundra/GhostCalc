Phasmaphobia Ghost Calculator 

This is an upgraded logic calculator for the game Phasmophobia written in Java. You can check out the source code in the src folder and if you want to try it out yourself you can download the .jar file.

If you have downloaded the .jar and nothing opens when opening the file, try downloading the most recent Java JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html (10/6/2020) and then try opening again.

Please leave suggestions or issues on this page or you can shoot me a DM on Discord @Tundra#7777
