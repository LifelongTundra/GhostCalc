# GhostCalc
Phasmaphobia Ghost Calculator 

This is an upgraded logic calculator for the game Phasmophobia written in Java. You can check out the source code in the src folder and if you want to try it out yourself you can download the .jar file.

Currently the calculate button DOES NOT do anything. It was original going to update the list, however, the possibility list now auto updates after every button press and now the calculate button serves the purpose of a debugging tool. Again unless you downloaded and are running the code through a Java IDE it will do nothing.

If you have downloaded the .jar and nothing opens when opening the file, try downloading the most recent Java JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html (10/6/2020) and then try opening again.
