# GhostCalc
Phasmaphobia Ghost Calculator 

This is an upgraded logic calculator for the game Phasmophobia written in Java. You can check out the source code in the src folder and if you want to try it out yourself you can download the .jar file.

Currently the calculate button DOES NOT do anything. It was original going to update the list, however, the possibility list now auto updates after every button press and now the calculate button serves the purpose of a debugging tool. Again unless you downloaded and are running the code through a Java IDE it will do nothing.

If you have downloaded the .jar and nothing opens when opening the file, try downloading the most recent Java JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html (10/6/2020) and then try opening again.

Please leave suggestions or issues on this page or you can shoot me a DM on Discord @Tundra#7777 

(Update 10/8/20) Version 3.0 is currently on its way with the addition of a ghost description tab! Once you have narrowed it down to at least three ghost, this tab will let you know the description of the ghost and all of its needed eveidence. I will update the Java executable when a stable finish version is produced, however, the new source code is up to look at. I updated the logic for storing the possible and impossible ghosts, which also allows for very easy additions of new ghosts whenever the game adds new ones in.
