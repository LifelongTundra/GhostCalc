# GhostCalc
Phasmaphobia Ghost Calculator 

This is an upgraded logic calculator for the game Phasmophobia written in Java. You can check out the source code in the src folder and if you want to try it out yourself you can download the .jar file.

In this build the calculate button DOES NOT do anything. It was original going to update the list, however, the possibility list now auto updates after every button press. The calculate button currently serves as a debugging tool used to track the attributes of the ghost that you hunting. Again unless you download and are run the code through a Java IDE nothing will occur.

If you have downloaded the .jar and nothing opens when opening the file, try downloading the most recent Java JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html (10/6/2020) and then try opening again.

(Update 10/8/20) Version 3.0 is currently on its way with the addition of a ghost description tab! Once you have narrowed it down to at least three ghost, this tab will let you know the description of the ghost and all of its needed eveidence. 

(Update 10/10/20) Version 3.0 is finished and the code and Java executable are up to date and ready to be used! Like in the previous update a description tab was added so you can see what the description of the remaining ghost is as well as the evidence that you haven't found for the specific ghost. Sample pictures were also updated to display the new layout and design.
